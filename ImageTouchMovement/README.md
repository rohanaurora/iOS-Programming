#ImageTouchMovement

**Move an image in your view using touch event**

This [question](http://stackoverflow.com/questions/24376784/move-an-image-on-a-uiview-in-ios-xcode) was asked today on Stackoverflow. I decided to spend some time and write code from scratch to move an image in the view based on touched (I did take help from other examples).

Instructions -

1) Open *ImageTouchMovement.xcworkspace* in Xcode 5.0 or later

2) Build the project `Shift âŒ˜ R`

3) Click and drag the image in your view
